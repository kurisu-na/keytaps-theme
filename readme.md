# keytaps-theme
A redesign of my writing blog, Key Taps and Coffee Breaks.

For personal use only. Based on the WP Bootstrap Starter. Uses the <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/58673">Light Delineation</a> color palette.

## An Important Change in v1.3
I no longer use Fiverr and Behance. Deleted those links.

## An Important Change in v1.2
The footer logo is hardcoded to link to my portfolio site. If you want to change it, you'll have to go to <code>footer.php</code> and change the link inside `<div class="navbar-brand justify-content-center">`.
